'''
Script to print moon phase times for a given year, which should be the
single parameter passed on the command line.  The times will be converted
to your local time by the ut_offset value, which gets added to the 
calculated universal time for the phase.  You'll want to modify the
ConvertToLocalTime() function to make its output appropriate for your
location.  You can also make it do nothing, which results in the 
program printing its times in UT.

Converted to python from moon.c program from June 1995.  Algorithms
from Meeus, Astronomical Formulas for Calculators, 2nd ed., 1982.
