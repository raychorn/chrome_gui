'''
Provides the Bsearch class that can be used to perform a binary
search in a sorted file or a large list (if the list is not large,
you'd probably just want to use the python builtin 'in' for doing
a linear search or convert the data to a dictionary).

    searches for a key.  You can initialize it with either a
    sorted list (or a sorted tuple) or a file object.  For a file 
    object, you must give the record size and the number of records 
    in the file.  You can also specify an initial offset in the file 
    to where the first record occurs.  You also need to provide a 
    compare function that returns -1 for <, 0 for ==, and 1 for >.
