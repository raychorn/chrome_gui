def Usage():
    print '''Usage:  fcut [options] file n:m [n1:m2 ...]

Prints specified line number ranges of a file.  Line numbering is 1-based
and ranges are inclusive.

    n:m      Print lines n through m
    n:       Print from line n to end of file
     :m      Print from line 1 to line m
     :       Print all lines of the file

If n is negative, it means to count from the last line of the file 
backwards.

Options:  -n numbers the lines and -r reverses the sense of the
specification.

Examples:
    fcut file 10:-10
        Chop off the first and last 10 lines of the file.

    fcut file :10 -10:
    fcut -r file 10:-10
        Prints the first 10 and last 10 lines of the file.

    fcut -n file :
        Number all the lines of the file
