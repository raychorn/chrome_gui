'''
This module defines the Tree() function.  This function will return 
a list of strings that represent the directory tree for the directory
passed into the function.  The calling syntax is:

    Tree(dir, indent, leading_char)

The variable indent controls how much each subdirectory is indented
on each line.  The variable leading_char sets the leading character
in the list; '|' might not be a bad choice.

If you call the module as a script, it will print the tree to stdout
for the directory you pass in on the command line (defaults to '.').
