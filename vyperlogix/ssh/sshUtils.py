The python 'b' flag is ignored, since SSH treats all files as binary. The 'U' flag is supported in a compatible way.

        For each directory in the remote directory tree rooted at top (including top
        itself, but excluding '.' and '..'), yields a 3-tuple
    
            dirpath, dirnames, filenames
    
        dirpath is a string, the path to the directory.  dirnames is a list of
        the names of the subdirectories in dirpath (excluding '.' and '..').
        filenames is a list of the names of the non-directory files in dirpath.
        Note that the names in the lists are just names, with no path components.
        To get a full path (which begins with top) to a file or directory in
        dirpath, do os.path.join(dirpath, name).
    
        If optional arg 'topdown' is true or not specified, the triple for a
        directory is generated before the triples for any of its subdirectories
        (directories are generated top down).  If topdown is false, the triple
        for a directory is generated after the triples for all of its
        subdirectories (directories are generated bottom up).
    
        When topdown is true, the caller can modify the dirnames list in-place
        (e.g., via del or slice assignment), and walk will only recurse into the
        subdirectories whose names remain in dirnames; this can be used to prune
        the search, or to impose a specific order of visiting.  Modifying
        dirnames when topdown is false is ineffective, since the directories in
        dirnames have already been generated by the time dirnames itself is
        generated.
    
        By default errors from the os.listdir() call are ignored.  If
        optional arg 'onerror' is specified, it should be a function; it
        will be called with one argument, an os.error instance.  It can
        report the error to continue with the walk, or raise the exception
        to abort the walk.  Note that the filename is available as the
        filename attribute of the exception object.
    
        Caution:  if you pass a relative pathname for top, don't change the
        current working directory between resumptions of walk.  walk never
        changes the current directory, and assumes that the client doesn't
        either.
    
        Example:
    
        from os.path import join, getsize
        for root, dirs, files in walk('python/Lib/email'):
            print root, "consumes",
            print sum([getsize(join(root, name)) for name in files]),
            print "bytes in", len(files), "non-directory files"
