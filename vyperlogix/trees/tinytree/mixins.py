    This MixIn provides the tinytree.tree with the ability to render itself as a nested Python dict {} to allow for pickling.
    
    The assumption is that all Node classes that use this MixIn will either use the properties_idiom to define properties or
    implement instance vars to define properties.
    
    Also the __init__() method must specify optional params for all of the properties that init the Node which means
    the Node instance must be capable of being initialized via the individual params rather than only via the __init__()
    method.
