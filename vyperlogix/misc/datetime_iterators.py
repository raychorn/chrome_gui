Western-language descriptions of recurrence tend to fall into
two distinct types. In order to provide some mnemonic consistency,
the base functions are named differently according to these types.
However, despite the differing names, every function yields
datetime.date or datetime.datetime objects.

First, there are the declarations which define a unit of time,
and then count successive "leaps" of those units. For example,
the declaration, "every 4 days," uses a day as the unit, and adds
4 to produce each value in the series. The functions which provide
these series are named according to the whole unit, in the plural.
Examples:
    "Every 4 days" becomes: days(start, 4, [end])
    "Every 2 weeks" becomes: weeks(start, 2, [end])
    "Every 6 hours" becomes: hours(start, 6, [end])

Second, there are the declarations which define a unit of time,
and then count by subdivisions of that unit. For example, the
declaration, "the ninth day of each month," uses a month as the
whole units and a day as the subdivision. The functions which
provide these series are named according to the whole unit,
in the singular, prefixed by "each".
Examples:
    "The ninth [day] of each month" becomes: eachmonth(start, 9, [end])
    "The penultimate [day] of each month" becomes:
        eachmonth(start, -1, [end])
    "Every Thursday" becomes "The 3rd [day] of each week" [since
        datetime.weekday() returns Thursday as the value 3]
        which becomes: eachweek(start, 3, [end])
    "08:30:00 on each day" becomes:
        eachday(start, datetime.time(8, 30), [end])
Notice that, in almost every case, the subdivision is understood to be
the "next smallest component". In the example above, one might just as
well have written, "the ninth of each month," and been understood,
since months are "composed of" days (not weeks!). Therefore, our
functions do not incorporate this "smaller unit" in the function name.
