"""
Rather than defining your get/set/del methods at the class level, as is usually done, e.g.

class MyClass(object):
    def __init__(self):
        self._foo = "foo"

    def getfoo(self):
        return self._foo
    def setfoo(self, value):
        self._foo = value
    def delfoo(self):
        del self._foo
    foo = property(getfoo, setfoo, delfoo, "property foo's doc string")

I would like to suggest the following alternative idiom:
